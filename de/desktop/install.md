# Installing Seafile Desktop Client

After downloading Seafile client program, you have 3 steps left to get it up and running.

## 3. Sync a library

## 5. Browse files on the cloud
In some occasions, you want to modify files on the cloud directly without syncing them. Seafile client comes with a "cloud file browser" to meet this need. Click an unsynced library will open the cloud file browser.
