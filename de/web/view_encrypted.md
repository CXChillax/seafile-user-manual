# Viewing an encrypted library

Seafile servers don't store the password for an encrypted library. To view an encrypted library online,
you need to temporarily provide the password to the server.

Your password is only recorded in the server's encrypted memory. It would be cleared from the memory in an hour.
After that, if you want to view the library, you'll have to enter password again.
